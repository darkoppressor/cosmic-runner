Note:
Should tell what is being smuggled and to where
Probably show this under the contract arrow
So each planet will need a name
Each game has a pcg world, so the planets are different each time
Maybe the planets could be the same (name, look) but be in different places each time
Also, will need a list of things to smuggle

Lift off animation complementing landing?

Note: change map screen to a minimap? It would be like now and show the star and planets
