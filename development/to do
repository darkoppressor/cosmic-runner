Test all passive upgrades

Note: change map screen to a minimap? It would be like now and show the planets

Design and implement HUD
Weapon cooldown/weapon enabled status
Active cooldown/active status (for actives that are enabled/disabled)

Police should not use their scanners when chasing the player

If player start speed/maneuvering stays as is, tractor beams need to be weakened

Initial number of ships need to be a little higher

Add a window for viewing all acquired upgrades

Idea: Gain points for narrowly dodging debris
Should you be able to kill yourself (via power drain) using active upgrades?
Note: high score board
