Add audio device to audio options screen
Any other options that need this?
Change default controller controls: swap map and drop, then swap map and active
Change skip this upgrade to skip upgrade and gain hull
Maybe slightly reduce item spawns
Change default touch controller opacity to low
Show death cause on game over screen
Make title clouds less likely
Need loading screen for world generation
Make custom backgrounds for the two loading screens
Use smaller font on about screen, remove need for scrolling
Upgrade icons for upgrade selection and viewing windows
Upgrade selection should have a totally custom look. More fun window background, figure out titlebar, no X button, fun background for buttons, will need those upgrade icons
Ideally need a better way to access upgrade view screen, then make it look like the buying screen

Music:
Menu music
Pause music
Choosing upgrade music
Peaceful music
Combat music
Police chase music
Game over music

Add help screens
There is a bug where sometimes the cooldown bar shows when it is empty

Android bar colors don't work
Branch raknet
Branch sfxr
Clean up my sfxr changes and make a new branch with them
Can I add sfxr remembering last opened dir?
