Do controllers work on Android?

Add engine setting for touch as mouse or as touch
Add touch controls input mode
Should replace basic gui stuff with its own version
Need to be able to click elements like with mouse, click and hold to drag, click and hold to scroll
How does engine decide initial input mode? It should default to touch if touch is available
Touch mode needs bigger buttons, including X button
Disabling touch controller in game needs restart, but enabling doesn't?
Ingame, how might this work?
Single finger touch should work much like the mouse does now
Can see finger up, down, and motion events
Can also support gestures

Pause / menu should be merged
Touch mode specific:
Show HUD button for pause / menu
Move by dragging around on left side of screen
HUD button for minimap
Close minimap by tapping anywhere
Hold on right side of screen to brake
Swipe down on right to land
Two finger swipe down on right to drop cargo
Swipe right on right to toggle weapons
Swipe up on right to use active

Upgrade icons for upgrade selection and viewing windows
Upgrade selection should have a totally custom look. More fun window background, figure out titlebar, no X button, fun background for buttons, will need those upgrade icons
Ideally need a better way to access upgrade view screen, then make it look like the buying screen

Music:
Menu music
Pause music
Choosing upgrade music
Peaceful music
Combat music
Police chase music
Game over music

Add help screens
There is a bug where sometimes the cooldown bar shows when it is empty
