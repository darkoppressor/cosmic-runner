Remove debris from minimap?
Remove background for minimap?
Remove border for minimap or keep it?

Police should not use their scanners when chasing the player

If player start speed/maneuvering stays as is, tractor beams need to be weakened
Or, player start speed/maneuvering should be increased again

Initial number of ships needs to be a little higher

Should you be able to kill yourself (via power drain) using active upgrades?

Idea: Gain points for narrowly dodging debris

Note: high score board

Test all passive upgrades
