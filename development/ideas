Polish ideas:
A fancier replacement for toast text involving gameplay stuff
Bigger windows/fonts
Fancy graphics for windows/buttons?
Gussy up the scrolling buttons window for buying upgrades
Upgrade icons for upgrade selection and viewing windows
Clouds floating over planets
Ship shadows on planet below ship
Fire/smoke effects for ship engines and missiles/guided missiles
Effects for weapons firing
Ships dying should spawn a number of hull damage effects
Variations for graphics?
Variations for sounds?
Animated sprites for weapons on ships?
Add a second hull damage effect that is smoke, and which one is used is randomly chosen each time
Whenever hull damage effects are spawned, also create a brief, fairly large "cross" graphic effect to show clearly
where the damage occurred (what color? and only for the player, or other ships too?)
Make asteroids look better

Fire/smoke effects for title ship engines
Clouds drifting across title screen
Animated birds flying across title screen
Title screen ships can have their speed tied to their scale, instead of being randomized
Title screen birds could have this, too, but their base speed is slower, and they are usually closer to the "screen"
Palm trees swaying in the breeze on the title screen hills

Cheese and Bacon logo on title screen should be on a billboard

Lift off animation complementing landing?

Should tell what is being smuggled and to where
Probably show this under the contract arrow
So each planet will need a name
Each game has a pcg world, so the planets are different each time
Maybe the planets could be the same (name, look) but be in different places each time
Also, will need a list of things to smuggle
