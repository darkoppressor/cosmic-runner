Arcade style, you play until you quit or lose
Single player
A game takes place in a pcg star system of set size
Game world is static (world objects don't move)
Player is a smuggler
Player controls a single spaceship

Ships have a collision box
Ships can thrust in 8 directions
Ships do not decelerate naturally
Ships have a brake that decelerates them to a stop
Ships have an acceleration thrust
Ships have a separate deceleration thrust, used for braking
Ships have a velocity
Ships have a maximum velocity
Player begins at a planet, with an initial smuggling contract
A contract is completed by landing on the contract planet
When completing a contract, a new contract is assigned
A new contract fills the player's cargo hold with cargo
Player always has either one or zero contracts
Player can drop cargo at any time
Dropping cargo abandons the current contract
Dropped cargo cannot be picked back up
Player can land on a planet
Player can view a map of the star system
The current contract target is shown on the map
A directional indicator pointing from the player to the contract target is shown on the map
A directional indicator is also shown in the game world
A notifier is shown when no contract is held
A notification should pop up briefly when a contract is completed
A notification should pop up briefly when a contract is lost
Player has a score
Player has a score multiplier
Score multiplier increases when a contract is completed
Score multiplier decreases when a contract is lost via the player being caught by police
When a contract is completed, the player must select one upgrade for their ship
There are three kinds of upgrades: active, passive, and weapon
Passive upgrades are permanent modifications to the ship
A ship may have up to one active upgrade at a time
If the player selects an active upgrade, and already has one, the old active upgrade is replaced with the new one
A ship can use its active upgrade
Active upgrades have a cooldown
There is a huge star in the center of the game world
Planets are dotted about
Star should have some kind of gravity, but only be dangerous really close to it (you CAN get caught in its gravity)
Star is only object with gravity
When really close to star, ships take energy damage over time
Collision with star kills any ship instantly
Ships have hull and shields
When a ship takes damage, it loses shields first, if it has any, and then hull
If a ship loses its hull entirely, it is destroyed, causing an explosion
If the player's ship is destroyed, it is a game over
Shields regen over time
Hull is restored from some kind of item
Items exist in the world, and are collected when touched
Only the player can collect items
If an item restores a stat, and the player has that stat at max, the item is not collected
Items can be generated in the world, or dropped by a destroyed ship
Items do not move
There are three types of damage:
Solid: x2 to Shields, /2 to Hull
Explosive: x1.5 to Hull, x1.5 to Shields
Energy: x2 to Hull, /2 to Shields
A ship may have up to one weapon upgrade at a time
If the player selects a weapon upgrade, and already has one, the old weapon upgrade is replaced with the new one
Weapons fire automatically on a cooldown
Ships can enable/disable their weapon's firing
Weapons continue cooling down when disabled
Each weapon fires one kind of shot: bullet, torpedo, missile, or plasma blast
Bullets fly straight very fast and do solid damage on contact
Torpedos fly straight and explode on contact
Missiles are just like torpedos, but they follow the nearest target
Plasma blasts fly straight extremely fast (cannot miss any ship) and do energy damage on contact
Bullets and plasma blasts are destroyed when they deal damage, and thus can only damage one target, once
Shots despawn if they are far from the player
Explosions can hit any number of targets, once each, and deal explosive damage
Player's ship has power (and only the player's ship)
Power decreases over time
If power runs out, player's ship is disabled and it is game over
Power is replenished with an item
A disabled ship stops responding to all controls, weapons do not fire (but weapons enabled status is unchanged),
any active upgrade ability is disabled, shields do not recharge, and the following passive upgrade abilities
are disabled if present: Point Defense
Player has notoriety
Notoriety decreases over time
Notoriety increases when player does damage to civilian or police ships
NPC ships are spawned "near" the player
NPC ships far away from the player are despawned
While NPC ships have no active or passive upgrades, they can be equipped with up to one weapon upgrade
For the purposes of NPC ships reacting to another ship, they always only look at the closest ship not of their faction
Ships and shots have a faction
Factions are: player, civilian, police, pirate
Faction is used by ships and shots to determine target to follow
The player is manually controlled obviously
Civilians spawn with a nearby target planet randomly selected, and try to fly there
Civilians can spawn anywhere
If they reach their target, they "land" and despawn
If they see a pirate ship, or a player ship and the player has high enough notoriety, they flee from it
If they are fleeing and no longer have a reason to, they resume their course for their target
Civilians have no weapons
Pirates spawn wandering at random
Pirates only spawn when player is in deep space
Pirates flee from police and the player if they have high enough notoriety (needs to be higher than for civilians to flee from the player)
Pirates chase civilians and the player if their notoriety is too low
Police spawn patrolling between their spawn point and a target point in a straight line
Police only spawn when player is near a planet
Police flee from no one
Police chase pirates
Police chase the player if their notoriety is high enough (same level as for civilians to flee from the player)
However, Police treatment of player is variable when they are chasing him
If the player is chasable but not scary to pirates, police will attempt to catch player in tractor beam
If player is scary to pirates, police will attempt to kill player
Tractor beam is shortish range special police ability
Once active, it cannot be escaped by normal flight (unless maybe engines are very upgraded?)
A tractored player is ignored by all other ships
A tractoring ship brakes
The tractor beam pulls the player in towards the tractoring ship
When the player reaches the tractoring ship, the player is caught
If the player leaves tractoring range, the tractoring ship stops tractoring and resumes normal behavior
When the player is caught, any contract is lost, and notoriety is reset to 0
All non-player ships use their active upgrade (if any) as often as they can,
unless they are a police ship currently tractoring the player
Asteroids are scattered around the game world
Asteroids do not move
Asteroids do solid damage when colliding with a ship
No collision between ships
No collision between shots
No collision with planets
When near a planet, background should have planety stuff
Otherwise, player is in deep space, and background is just stars

Weapon Upgrades:
Shotgun Cannon: Fires bullets in a shotgun pattern, centered on target
Sniper Cannon: Fires a single bullet at the target
Quad Cannon: Fires 4 bullets in the 4 "cardinal directions", with the target being north
Single Torpedo: Fires a single torpedo at the target
Spread Torpedo: Fires a spread of torpedoes centered on the target
Circle Torpedo: Fires a complete circle of evenly spaced torpedoes centered on the ship
Single Missile: Fires a single slow missile at the target
Triple Missile: Fires a spread of 3 slow missiles centered on the target
Swarm Missile: Fires a large spread of several fast missiles centered on the target
Plasma Gun: Locks onto the target briefly with a laser, then fires a plasma blast at the target

Active Upgrades:
Scanner: Only available to police ships. Has a brief startup animation during which time it is ineffective.
Once it has started up, it scans an area around the ship, in an obvious way. If this scan sees the player's ship,
the player's ship's cloak is disabled (if any), and if the player has a contract, his notoriety increases.
This upgrade consumes a set amount of power per use
EMP: Fires a circular pulse centered on the ship that expands to a set radius and then vanishes. Any ships caught in
this pulse (ignoring the firing ship) are disabled for a set period of time
This upgrade consumes a set amount of power per use
Cloak: While this is active, the ship is invisible (the player's own ship will still be shown, but semi-transparent).
No ships or shots can see the ship at all for AI purposes.
This upgrade begins cooling down when the cloak is disabled
This upgrade consumes power at a set rate while it is active
Warp Drive: While this is active, all collision is ignored,
and no ships or shots can see the ship at all for AI purposes. Ship controls do not respond while this is active,
with the exception of disabling the Warp Drive. Separate "warp" acceleration thrust and max velocity are used,
and the ship automatically thrusts continually in the direction it was facing when the warp drive was activated.
This upgrade begins cooling down when the warp drive is disabled
This upgrade consumes power at a set rate while it is active

Passive Upgrades:
Max Shields: Maximum shields increased
Shield Recharge Rate: Shield recharge rate increased
Max Hull: Maximum hull increased
Point Defense: A laser fires automatically on a cooldown at any nearby hostile torpedo or missile. Torpedoes and
missiles hit by this laser instantly explode
Acceleration/Deceleration Thrust: Increases both acceleration and deceleration thrust
Max Velocity: Increases maximum velocity
Slower Power Loss: Regular power loss (ignoring use by active upgrades) is slowed
Cooldown Reduction: Cooldowns on all upgrades that have them are reduced
Anti-gravity System: The effects of gravity are greatly reduced
