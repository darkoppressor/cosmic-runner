This is the source code for a game currently being developed by Cheese and Bacon Games.

Cosmic Runner is a top-down, 2D action game in an arcade-y style. The game world is procedurally generated.
The player controls a spaceship, and smuggles cargo from planet to planet. The player must avoid police ships,
which periodically scan the cargo of nearby ships. The player must also avoid pirates, who will attack without warning,
and may prey upon civilian ships. Causing too much havoc can lead to police ships attempting to arrest the player,
or even destroy them outright. Becoming truly infamous leads to the spawning of bounty hunters that seek only the player's destruction.
As the player completes cargo runs and increases their score and score multiplier, they obtain upgrades for their ship.
Ship upgrades can be one of three categories:
Passive: simply improves some feature of the ship
Active: usable with the active skill key, and causes some specific event to occur
Weapon: fires automatically at nearby ships if weapons systems are enabled
